# 👋 I'm Chris - Nice to meet you

**Analytics Engineer | Data Architect | Solution Designer**

Welcome to my GitHub — I build pipelines, models, and insights that bridge raw data to real-world decisions.

## 🔍 **About Me**

I’m an analytics engineer with a passion for elegant data solutions, clean architecture, and meaningful storytelling. My work blends robust engineering with clear, actionable insights — helping teams move from **data** to **impact**.

I love working at the intersection of:
- **Data Engineering:** pipelines, orchestration, cloud architecture.
- **Analytics Engineering:** dbt, Snowflake, DuckDB.
- **Visualization & Insights:** EDA, dashboards, storytelling.
