# Hey, I'm Chris

**Senior Data Engineer | Data Platform Architecture | Snowflake · dbt · Airflow · Python**

I build the infrastructure that makes data teams self-sufficient: ingestion systems, warehouse layers, internal tooling, and the standards that hold it together at scale.

## About Me

I'm a Senior Data Engineer with 8 years of experience designing and operating production data platforms from inception to enterprise scale. At Samsung Electronics America, I co-architected North America's centralized analytics infrastructure in Snowflake, establishing cross-platform ingestion, dimensional modeling standards, orchestration frameworks, and internal tooling now shared across a team of 12 serving 200+ users.

I think about data work in layers:

- **Ingestion** — Snowpipes, external stages, IAM/S3 trust policies, cross-account architecture
- **Warehouse** — ELT-first schemas, data contracts, cost strategy, performance optimization
- **Curated assets** — dimensional models, semantic layers, certified datasets, metric logic
- **Handoff** — shared Python libraries, reusable dbt macros, CI/CD, documentation, standards

My stakeholders are the engineers and analysts building on top of what I ship. That shapes how I design everything.

## Professional Highlights

**Samsung Electronics America** | Senior Data Engineer | March 2024 – Present

- Architected cross-platform ingestion infrastructure using Snowpipes, external stages, and cross-account IAM/S3 trust policies; unified intra-day batch ingestion across 7 business domains serving 1B+ active devices and 700M+ Samsung accounts; 120% throughput improvement over legacy architecture
- Maintained monthly compute spend ~60% below enterprise baseline through warehouse tiering, clustering, and query optimization
- Built internal platform tooling to scale the team from 3 to 12: shared Python libraries, reusable dbt macros, standardized APIs, Git standards, and CI/CD via Airflow and GitHub Actions
- Lead Engineer on Project Prism: integrated 20+ third-party advertising sources, established the first enterprise-wide 3-tier transaction taxonomy, deployed a dbt data quality framework across 50+ models in OpenMetadata — now the company-wide source of truth

**Samsung Electronics America** | Data Engineer, Partnerships | January 2022 – March 2024

- Architected Samsung North America's first federated analytics platform from the ground up: Snowflake provisioning, ELT-first schemas, data contracts, and testing
- Built the semantic and curated asset layer serving 70+ users: 30+ certified dimensional models in dbt encoding business definitions, data quality expectations, and metric logic
- Designed canonical revenue attribution model in Snowflake ingesting 20+ external sources; delivered metric credibility for $1B+ in amortized global revenue; adopted as executive reporting system of record
- Led migration of three legacy MariaDB systems to Snowflake; retired a custom Python ETL framework; improved build times by 80%

**CNN** | Senior Data Analyst, Ad Sales | April 2018 – January 2022

- Consolidated fragmented SQL reporting logic into a coordinated data model, reducing result file count by 75% and powering 4 reporting lines from a unified source
- Developed Python reporting framework for Original Series; uncovered and corrected a data integrity issue causing 12% audience miscounts traced to an upstream provider feed
- Built unified social listening pipeline integrating 6 data sources with Python-based validation enabling multiplatform performance reporting across 3 teams
