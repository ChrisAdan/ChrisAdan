# 👋 I'm Chris - Nice to meet you

**Senior Data Engineer | Data Architect | Solution Designer**

Welcome to my GitHub — I build pipelines, models, and insights that bridge raw data to real-world decisions.

---

## 🔍 **About Me**

I'm a Senior Data Engineer with 8 years of experience building and scaling production analytics platforms from foundation to enterprise adoption. Currently at Samsung Electronics America, I architected North America's modern data infrastructure in Snowflake from the ground up, serving 200+ users across advertising, partnerships, and product teams.

My work blends robust engineering with clear, actionable insights — helping teams move from **data** to **impact**.

I specialize in:
- **Data Engineering:** Snowflake, AWS, orchestration, cloud architecture
- **Analytics Engineering:** dbt, Python, dimensional modeling, data quality frameworks
- **Platform Leadership:** Scaling teams, establishing standards, cost optimization
